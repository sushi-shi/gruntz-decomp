# Wall breaks

This is the evidence ledger for walls broken while applying the HoMM3
`wall-identifier` doctrine to Gruntz. Entries follow the classifier order:
inliner, control flow, then register allocation. A score change alone is not a
break; the retail instruction, relocation, or table evidence must identify the
compiler decision, and a real VC5 build must confirm the fix.

## 2026-08-11 — `CTileTriggerLogic::LoadBridgeMove`

- Unit/RVA: `tileswitchlogic`, `0x00110860`.
- Before: 99.9887% historical MAX; executable instructions, 28 conditional
  branches, five returns, and the relocation multiset agreed.
- Classification: control flow, specifically dense-switch IR arm identity. The
  entire objdiff residue was three byte-index entries: candidate
  `00 07 07 07`, retail `00 00 00 00` for cases 15–18.
- Source lever: replace the empty-case `break;` with an explicit `goto done;`
  to a shared final `return;`. This keeps all four labels on retail slot 0
  instead of folding the last three into default slot 7.
- Verdict: 100.00% exact; current exact-function total increased 3,543 → 3,544.

## 2026-08-11 — `CGameLevel::ProbeFootSoft`

- Unit/RVA: `gamelevel`, `0x00160080`.
- Before: 99.9863% historical MAX. The only residue was the order of two
  independent member loads used by one addition; the 14 branches, two returns,
  function size, and empty relocation multisets agreed.
- Classification: register allocation driven by TU-wide compiler handle state.
  Reversing the commutative expression, naming locals in retail load order, and
  seeding then widening the row were byte-identical at 99.9863%.
- Probe evidence: the mixed declaration-family sweep reached exact in 44 of 60
  disposable TU states, including trial 1. The exact state preserved the 391-byte
  function size and zero relocations; the real source and its hash
  (`a7b2facaa76c`) remained unchanged.
- Verdict: 100.00% historical MAX banked from an audited exact TU state; all
  probe declarations were removed.

## 2026-08-11 — `CGruntPuddle::Place`

- Unit/RVA: `wormhole`, `0x00040c30`.
- Before: 73.5400%. The body kept `placeIndex` in `edi`, shifting nearly every
  stack operand and the zero-case schedule.
- Classification: source defect first, then a bounded scheduling wall. Tracking
  the argument homes through retail's early `push 0` proves the post-lookup
  test reads the third argument (`color`), not the second (`placeIndex`).
- Source lever: change `if (placeIndex == 0)` to `if (color == 0)`. This removes
  the false live range and restores retail's prologue, parameter loads, member
  stores, calls, and all seven relocations.
- Result: 93.5600%. The residue is two independent load/store and
  load/argument-push transpositions. A receiver local, 60 mixed TU states, and
  33 AST variants were byte-identical, so the remaining scheduler residue is
  parked while the behavior correction is retained.

## 2026-08-11 — `CWwdGrid::Setup` (ongoing)

- Unit/RVA: `wwdgrid`, `0x001915c0`.
- Before: 80.8718%. The body has the right arithmetic and allocation calls, but
  its `RECT` parameter homes and allocation epilogue layout differ.
- Source levers measured: all 24 semantically equivalent aggregate field-init
  orders crossed with shared-tail versus positive-success allocation exits.
  Twelve orders tie for the best only with the positive-success shape.
- Result: 82.79% current with top/right/left/bottom initialization and
  `if (arr) { m_allocated = 1; return 1; } return 0;`. Three additional exit
  spellings did not reproduce retail's duplicated EH epilogues. This function
  remains active and is not marked `@early-stop`.
